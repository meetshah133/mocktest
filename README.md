# mocktest

One of the major issue faced by educational institute is taking mocktest of the student. The traditional pen and paper based mocktest is time consuming . Getting the analysis from this mocktest is very difficult . So we have designed a python application to solve this problem.
Libraries used :
1.)	SQLITE3 (Database)
2.)	Tkinter (GUI)
3.)	Matplotlib and Numpy (Data Analysis)
This mocktest application used sqlite3 as its database and is designed using tkinter which is a python GUI tool . We have provided two login option one as faculty and other as teacher. Faculty can create a new mocktest by either manualing adding the questions or by uploading the text file consisting of the questions. They can also get the realtime analysis of scores scored by all the student who have attempted for that mocktest . We have done this analysis by using numpy and matlplotlib.pyplot to plot the pie diagram. Student can attempt the mocktest or can check the score of the previously given mocktest by logging into the application.
